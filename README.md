# Celine Kaslin :computer:

I am a curious, dynamic and hard-working person, always passionate about learning new skills.<br/>
I have start to learn coding on my own through online courses, starting by web development with HTML and CSS.<br/>
Afterwards the company I was working for in a sales - customer service role saw my potential and financed some more online courses about Python. Proving my motivation, abilities and passion for it, they offer me to join the platform team and gave me the amazing opportunity of my life to be trained to software development in a coding bootcamp.

I have always been interested to understand how things are working and interlinked to each other. I've started by trying to understand the humans thought by doing a MA in Philosophy and then by being graduated and working as a nurse in the complex area of mental health during 3 years.<br/>
I reached a point where I realized that the world and environment we are living in, have a bigger impact than we imagine on our behaviours and is what made and continue to make the changes for the future of the humanity.<br/>
I thought about our actual world and all this technology surrounding us and making our world going and progressing so fast. Those parameters in our life that we do not even notice but which are impacting so much on us, and on the future generations coming.<br/>

And from that point I decided that I wanted to understand how what is making our day to day life is working and to be part of it by being able to bring some contribution to it.<br/>
I discovered myself a passion in coding, because it ticks so much boxes of my personality and what I love to do.<br/>
I realised that going more than learning code for myself, but working as a developer will bring me the happiness to love what I am doing during the third of my life time, and will offer me to :

- Be continuously intellectually stimulated and challenged
- Have some space for creativity
- Exchange idea with team members and compare ways to think and to solve problems
- Regular learning process
- Be part of the technical evolution of the world

I am open to work in both back-end and front-end.<br/>
I would love to progress in a supportive, dynamic environment with an "always growing" and improving culture company, where I'll be able to bring my technical skills but also my positive and "sharing" solutions attitude and to increase my competences including to grow by a constant learning process.<br/>

## Skills ##

**Coding skills**

I have learned the basic of Python and I am able to solve basics challenges in this programming language.<br/>
I am having strong skills in Ruby programming language. I have built multiple software challenge, and web app using it and *Sinatra*.<br/>
I am also able to program basic web page in Javascript.<br/>
I am able to write Tests for my code. I am using *Rspec* and *Capybara* testing frameworks for Ruby, and *Jasmine* for Javascript.<br/>
For all the code I am building, I am using the TDD principles.<br/>
I am using Sublime text and Atom text editor to code. I have started to work with Visual studio in my previous company, but for now I still less comfortable with this one than the 2 others to work with. I really like that Atom is directly linked to Github and that I can see which of my files are in staging area, as most of my last commit.<br/>
As all developer I am using Github to show my work, and I am confident with the commands to use it.<br/>
All I did is on Github or on it way to be. So do not hesitate to check it.


**Fast and independent learner**

I have started to learn code on my own time, working on it during the evening after my full time job and during weekends. In few months I've started to build some coding skills in Python and Ruby, and I developed a better capacity in approaching, decomposing and solving problems.

I am able to rally and use all the resources needed to learn faster, which include : research on google, watching tutorial on you tube, read appropriates books, ask to developers I know some help when I am really stuck.
I have always been able to learn on my own in my life. I have learned guitar like that when I was teenager (that I sadly forgot because of a lack of practise).

When I joined my previous role, I have to familiarise with the software we were working with which is Sales force. My manager assure me that I caught really quickly how it was working and how to use it. He explained to me that they changed software 3 months ago and that some persons in the team where still struggling in how to use it and that he was impressed by my aptitude to learn how to use it (as all the process of the role) really quickly.


**Team worker - Communication focus**

I have always worked with a team, and I have always been the one trying to make all the person understand what was going on.

For example, when I was nurse and that we had an issue with some lack of material to work, I was the one going to the hierarchy to speak about what we were missing and to explain why we needed those specifics things. I was then going back to the team to let them know what was the point of view of our superior about it and which solution they will give.<br/>
It was the same if it has a conflict between 2 different teams working on different hours or, a recurrent issue with a patient. I was always trying to establish the communication between everyone and to clarify all the point of view, to be able to reach a point where everyone get the point of the other to get to an agreement and to fix the problem.<br/>
I always communicate with my colleague as well, about sharing the best practise, comparing what we were doing and trying to figure out what was the best.

I have liked to be the communication link between different team.<br/>
I guess that when you work as a nurse and then customer service, you focus on listen, understand, and bring solutions to people and you develop solid communication skills.

**Organisation**

I have always been organised in my personal life and even more in my work life. I like to have a "task program" in my head in how to structure my working day<br/>
Also when I have to approach a new software to built, I am organised in my process to decompose the user request.<br/>
I am writing a user story if non is given, extracting the main point, and diagraming how I will build the project, which allows me to elaborate a Minimum Viable Project to follow.

In my previous position as an international booking consultant, I was helping students to find an accommodation for their year of study. I have started in this role in July 2017 , so summer, which is the peak season. It means that we had to deal with a huge amount of phone call and request, and had at the same time to be able to contact the properties to satisfy the request of the students and make them book.<br/>
This part of the year is the busiest one and you need to be well organised if you want to be able to treat and get in touch with all the students assigned to you every day(around 120 per day).

My contract in the company was non permanent, and I was supposed to work just for the peak season, but at the end of my contract, one of the reason why they kept me as permanent was that I am very organised.<br/>
They pointed that I managed to start and handle it in the hardest period of the year, noticing that I was faster than other to work because of good my work organisation.
