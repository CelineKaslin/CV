# Celine Kaslin :computer:

I am a curious and hard-working person, always passionate about learning new skills.<br/>
I have start to learn coding on my own through online courses.<br/>
Afterwards the company I was working for in a sales - customer service role saw my potential and financed more online courses about Python. Proving my motivation, abilities and passion for it, they offer me to join the platform team and gave me the amazing opportunity of my life to be trained to be a software developer at Makers Academy.

I have always been interested to understand how things are working and interlinked to each other. I've started by trying to understand the humans thought by doing a MA in Philosophy and then by being graduated and working as a nurse in the complex area of mental health during 3 years.<br/>
I reached a point where I realised that the world and environment we are living in, have a bigger impact than we imagine on our behaviours.<br/>
I thought about our actual world and all this technology surrounding us and making our world going and progressing so fast. Those parameters in our life, that we do not even notice, but which are impacting so much on us, and on the future generation.<br/>

From that point I have decided that I wanted to understand what is making our day to day life and how it works. I wanted to be part of it, by being able to bring some contribution to it.<br/>
I discovered myself a passion in coding, because it ticks so much boxes of my personality and what I love to do:<br/>

- Be continuously intellectually stimulated and challenged
- Have some space for creativity
- Exchange ideas with team members and compare ways to think and to solve problems
- Regular learning
- Be part of the technical evolution of the world

I am open to work in any area with any technology, as my main goal is to learn as much as I can.<br/>
I would love to progress in a supportive, dynamic environment with an "always growing" and improving culture company, where I'll be able to bring my technical skills but also my positive attitude and to increase my competences by a constant learning process.<br/>

## Skills ##

**Coding skills**

Basic Python and flask.
Good Ruby skills (multiple projects, and web app incorporing *Sinatra*).<br/>
Basic JS, good React skills (most of my current tasks are in React), using *Mobx* library.<br/>
Good knowledge of HTML, Css, Scss.<br/>
Familiar with *Rspec* and *Capybara* testing framework for Ruby, *Pytest* for Python and *Jasmine* for Javascript.<br/>
Good PostgreSQL knowledge.<br/>
Good PHP knowledge, using Laravel (MVC) framework, building Eloquent relationship and symfony routing.<br/>
Strong knowledge of the *git* commands â€“ using Github and Bitbucket.<br/>
Familiar with Sublime text, Atom and PHP Storm, currently using Visual Studio.<br/>
Good knowledge of Docker.<br/>

**Fast and independent learner**

I have started to learn code on my own time, working on it during the evening after my full time job and during weekends.<br/>
In a few months time, I've started to build some coding skills and I developed a better capacity in approaching, decomposing and solving problems.<br/>
When I joined the company I worked for, after finishing the coding bootcamp, I managed to quickly learn a new language and to get familiar with a whole new technical environment.<br/>

I am able to rally and use all the resources needed to learn faster, which include : research on google, watching tutorial on you tube, read appropriates books, ask to developers I know some help when I am really stuck.
I have always been able to learn on my own in my life.


**Team worker - Communication focus**

I have always worked within a team, and I have always been the one making the link between different teams.<br/>
Working as a nurse and then in customer service, I focused on listening, understanding, and bringing solutions to people. Therefore, I developed solid communication  skills, on the top of my social personality.<br/>
I am also an adept of Agile principle, which I find really beneficial for a team to work efficiently, as I like to communicate with my colleagues and share about the best practise.<br/>

I used those skills during all my team project at makers academy.<br/>
At the end of each project the team members were always grateful to me, for having help focus and pushed the team so much onto communication, always using the Agile processes.

**Organisation**

I have always been organised in my personal and work life. I like to prepare a list of tasks at the beginning of each morning to structure my working day.<br/>
When I have build a new piece of software/feature, I am organised in my process to decompose the user request:<br/>
I am writing a user story if none is given, extracting the main points, and diagraming how I will build the project.<br/>
This allows me to elaborate a Minimum Viable Project to follow.<br/>
This scoping process is done within the team, where I like to keep steps on track on some documentation.<br/>
I am also taking a lot of notes, which I organise into clear, tidy categories, to always find what I need quickly.<br/>
