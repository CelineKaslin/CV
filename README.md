# Celine Kaslin :computer:

I am a curious and hard-working person, always passionate about learning new skills.<br/>
I have start to learn coding on my own through online courses.<br/>
Afterwards the company I was working for in a sales - customer service role saw my potential and financed more online courses about Python. Proving my motivation, abilities and passion for it, they offer me to join the platform team and gave me the amazing opportunity of my life to be trained to be a software developer at Makers Academy.

I have always been interested to understand how things are working and interlinked to each other. I've started by trying to understand the humans thought by doing a MA in Philosophy and then by being graduated and working as a nurse in the complex area of mental health during 3 years.<br/>
I reached a point where I realised that the world and environment we are living in, have a bigger impact than we imagine on our behaviours and is what made and continue to make the changes for the future of the humanity.<br/>
I thought about our actual world and all this technology surrounding us and making our world going and progressing so fast. Those parameters in our life that we do not even notice but which are impacting so much on us, and on the future generations coming.<br/>

And from that point I have decided that I wanted to understand how what is making our day to day life is working and to be part of it by being able to bring some contribution to it.<br/>
I discovered myself a passion in coding, because it ticks so much boxes of my personality and what I love to do:<br/>

- Be continuously intellectually stimulated and challenged
- Have some space for creativity
- Exchange ideas with team members and compare ways to think and to solve problems
- Regular learning process
- Be part of the technical evolution of the world

I am open to work in any area with any technology, as my main goal is to learn always as much as I can.<br/>
I would love to progress in a supportive, dynamic environment with an "always growing" and improving culture company, where I'll be able to bring my technical skills but also my positive attitude and to increase my competences by a constant learning process.<br/>

## Skills ##

**Coding skills**

I have strong skills in Ruby. I have built multiple projects, and web apps which incorporate *Sinatra*.<br/>
I have learned the basics of Python and flask.<br/>
I am also able to program in Javascript to a good level.<br/>
I am following the strict principle of TDD for my code. I am using *Rspec* and *Capybara* testing frameworks for Ruby, *Pytest* for Python and *Jasmine* for Javascript.<br/>
I am using Github to show the flow of my work, and I am confident with the *git* commands.<br/>

**Fast and independent learner**

I have started to learn code on my own time, working on it during the evening after my full time job and during weekends.<br/>
I also picked up JavaScript in a week and developed a better capacity in approaching, decomposing and solving problems.

I am able to rally and use all the resources needed to learn faster, which include : research on google, watching tutorial on you tube, read appropriates books, ask to developers I know some help when I am really stuck.
I have always been able to learn on my own in my life.

When I joined my previous role, I have to familiarise with the software we were working with which is Sales force. My manager assure me that I caught really quickly how it was working and how to use it. They changed software 3 months ago and and some persons in the team where still struggling in how to use it.


**Team worker - Communication focus**

I have always worked in a team and I have often been the mediator.
For example, when I was nurse and that we had an issue , I was the one going to the hierarchy to speak about it. I was then going back to the team to let them know what went out from the discussion.<br/>
I always liked to communicate with my colleagues and share about the best practises.
When working as a nurse, my main focus was to listen, understand, and bring solutions to people, which allowed me to develop solid communication skills.

I used those skills during all my team project at makers academy.<br/>
At the end of each project the team members were always grateful to me for having focus and push the team so much onto communication, using the Agile processes.

**Organisation**

I have always been organised in my personal and work life. I like to prepare a list of tasks at the beginning of each morning to structure my working day.<br/>
Also when I have to approach a new software to build, I am organised in my process to decompose the user request.<br/>
I am writing a user story if none is given, extracting the main points, and diagraming how I will build the project.<br/>
This allows me to elaborate a Minimum Viable Project to follow.

In my previous position as an international booking consultant, I was helping students to find an accommodation for their year of study. I have started in this role during the summer 2017 , which is the peak season. It means that we had to deal with a huge amount of phone call and request.<br/>
This part of the year is the busiest one and requested to be well organised to be able to treat and get in touch with all the students assigned to you every day(around 120 per day).

My contract in the company was non permanent, and I was supposed to work just for the peak season, but at the end of my contract, one of the reason why they kept me as permanent was because I am very organised.<br/>
They pointed that I managed to start and handle the hardest period of the year, noticing that I was faster than other to work because of good my work organisation.
